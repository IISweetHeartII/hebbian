# TODOS

## Digest false positive reduction

Current correction detection fires on loose markers like "instead", "avoid", "않" (Korean)
in normal conversation. Long informational messages get incorrectly flagged as corrections.

**What it would do:** Add minimum confidence scoring — require 2+ correction markers
in the same message, or minimum keyword density relative to message length.

**Priority:** Medium. Candidate staging (Phase 4.2) is the safety net, but it doesn't
exist yet. Until then, false positives create noise neurons.
**Depends on:** Nothing (independent improvement)

## Mid-session re-emit hook

CLAUDE.md goes stale mid-session if the brain changes (via `grow`, `fire`, `inbox`).
The `SessionStart` hook only refreshes at session start.

**Fix:** Add a `PostToolUse` hook on `Edit|Write` that checks if the brain directory
was modified and re-emits CLAUDE.md. Or integrate with the existing `watch` command.

**Priority:** Low. Brain rarely changes mid-session in normal use.
**Depends on:** WS1 (hooks infrastructure)

## Deferred: Supervisor + Heartbeat (was Phase 6)

Process management for long-running hebbian services (api, watch).
CLI-first approach doesn't need this for the core use case.

**What it would do:** Exponential backoff restart, circuit breaker, memory limits,
deadlock detection, heartbeat priority queue.

**Priority:** Low. Revisit if hebbian gets long-running daemon use cases.

## Deferred: Live Injection Hook (was Phase 5)

Intercept https.request/fetch to inject brain into all LLM API requests.
emit + IDE hooks already cover Claude/Cursor/Gemini/Copilot targets.

**Priority:** Low. Only needed if an IDE has no hook/config file support.
**Source:** ROADMAP.md Phase 5, deferred during CEO review (2026-04-01)

## Deferred: MCP Server (was Phase 3)

JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio for MCP-compatible clients.
CLI hooks replace this entirely for Claude Code. Other MCP clients can use the REST API.

**Priority:** None. Revisit only if MCP becomes the dominant integration pattern.

## Deferred: Multi-brain composition

Global brain + per-project brain, with composition/override rules.
Needs design work: which brain wins on conflict? How to merge?

**Priority:** Medium. Natural extension of "Personal AI OS" vision.

## Deferred: Idle loop (auto-evolve)

Autonomous evolve cycle on 5-min API inactivity.
Start with manual `hebbian evolve`, add auto later.

**Priority:** Medium. Depends on evolve engine stability.
